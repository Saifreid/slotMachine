# slotMachine
This is a slot machine with 3 rows and 5 columns, it uses strings as visuals
The slot machine takes an input of an amount and a bet amount. currently there is a known bug but I am tired
so I will fix it tomorrow and tidy up the code better. I don't know much about slot machines so hos this one works currently is it randomly populates a 2d table then using
recursion it looks through the possible branches to find winners. After losing it should take away the amount bet from the balance and after winning it would add the amount 
bet to the balance.
